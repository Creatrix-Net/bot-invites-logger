# Bot Invites and Votes logger
It is a django app made as an utility for [Minato Namikaze](https://github.com/The-4th-Hokage/yondaime-hokage) to log keep a track of `invites` and `log votes from different sites` in a discord text channel.

Or in short: `This app implements the invite tracking and votes webhook of different botlists :)`
